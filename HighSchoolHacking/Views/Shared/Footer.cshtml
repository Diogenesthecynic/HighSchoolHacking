    <p>You're looking at the online hub for High School Hacking, a program to help high school students get into programming. Target students are grades 9 and up; schools that have Computer Science classes are preferred.
    <p>High School Hacking was created by Joshua Kevin Goldberg as a Microsoft Intern Ambassador in conjunction with the Computer Science Club, Upsilon Pi Epsilon chapter, and Tau Nu chapter of Phi Gamma Delta at RPI.
